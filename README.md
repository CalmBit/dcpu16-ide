DCPU-16 Emulator
================
This project is a Javascript assembler, emulator and debugger for the DCPU-16 processor.  

TODO
----
* order of operations bug
* remember breakpoints when switching between editor and debugger
* about box
* memory window scrolling (and coloration?)
* better error messages for assembly exceptions
* display CPU cycles when running
* load files from POST body
* maybe a way to save files?  use reddis? :)
* maybe make the theme look more like a spaceship?
* refactor UI code into separate JS objects / files
* set breakpoints in editor
